# Lightrom-hammerhead
# Only for Nexus 5 hammerhead!!
I haven't developed or ported any Lightrom before. This is my own project. All matches (including in the rom name) are random. Don't confuse with Adobe Lightroom! **You are on the page with Android AOSP/CM firmware/rom for phones!**
 
Completely stripped down ROM based on CyanogenMod 11. Almost all applications are cut out. Only the settings, music player, terminal and Titanium Backup remained. In the case of the ULTRA version - only the settings. You can install applications via ADB or terminal (not tested).
## Weight (for now)
- Lightrom - 168mb
- Lightrom ULTRA - 162mb
## Who needs this firmware? Is it for me?
Most likely no. For people who use youtube, twitter and so on, that is, ordinary people do not need it. If you want an iPod-like music player or just a video player. You don't like a lot of programs installed on your device or you just want multirom rom to test programs. Then it is most likely for you, but be aware that there are a lot of bugs here.
## When is the release?
Honestly, I do not know. Maybe I will delete this repository. Prerelease for Nexus 5 and alpha for Nexus 4 are now ready. As soon as I understand how to properly edit the system resources of APK files on linux, I will release the first release.
### What? Nexus 4 is being developed (contrary to the text below)? How well does it work?
What? Nexus 4 is still there (contrary to the text below)? How well does it work?
Yes, development for the Nexus 4 has begun (although I haven't even released it for the nexus 5). Since the CM firmware is different, some settings from the nexus 4 are missing in the nexus 5. There are fewer bugs, except for the fatal one. The back button doesn't work.
## Other phones
This firmware at the time of 03/22/22+ **DOES NOT SUIT ANYONE EXCEPT NEXUS 5 HAMMERHEAD!!!!! THE AUTHOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR A DAMAGED DEVICE!!!!** (although during installation you can hardly brick it, but believe me, it‚Äôs better not to try)
### Porting?
Maybe.
If it does, then first on nexus devices (4 and 10 (maybe)) and on Samsung devices (S2, S3, S7390). I'm not sure about others, I do it myself on my own devices.
## Bugs
Oh yeah. Bugs here are just a huge amount. Imagine all the people on earth (about 8 billion, right?) and multiply by 2. That will be the total number of bugs. Jokes aside, here are the known issues:
1. NFC - Partial work
2. Lockscreen - Can't set screen lock
3. Notification curtain - some shortcuts lead to system inoperability and reinstallation is required
4. Settings - Some items are throwing an error. (I know the fix, but let the rom be 1MB smaller)
5. Wallpapers - they are, but they write an error during installation. To fix it yourself, install the APK from cm11
#### LightromULTRA bugs:
1. All üòÖ
## Q&A
- Q - batus built in?
- A - No, lol.
- 
- Q - CM7/8/9/10/12/13/14? LinageOS?
- A - Here is a table:
- 7 - will be on S2.
- 8 - I don't have a cm8 capable device
- 9/10 - I don't know, probably yes, but not on nexus 5
- 12/13/14 - I don't think so. Only if I buy a Nexus older than 5X
- LinageOS - the same as with cm12+
- 
- Q - X86 arch?
- A - 90% NO. Only if there is a desire. And who needs a neutered cyanogenmod on a PC?
- 
- Q - Anything other than Lightrom based and Ultra?
- A - Yes. There will be an extended release (LightromEXtented?) where there will be a calculator, a camera and similar necessary things.

## All devices that have a chance to get LightROM:
- cm6 and below - no information yet
- cm7 - so far only Galaxy S2, but I have a little problem with it
- cm8 - I would like to, but there is no information yet
- cm9 - Galaxy S2/S3.
- cm10 - Galaxy S2/S3, mi4c?, Nexus4?, Galaxy S7390, Lenovo A369i
- cm11 - Galaxy S2/S3, mi4c?, Nexus4/5/10?, Galaxy S7390, Lenovo A369i
- cm12 - Galaxy S2/S3, mi4c, Nexus4/5/10, Lenovo A369i
- cm13 - Galaxy S2/S3, mi4c, Nexus4/5/10, Lenovo A369i
- cm14 - Galaxy S2/S3, mi4c, Nexus4/5/10, Lenovo A369i (will not be on cm)
- LinageOS+ - Galaxy S2/S3, mi4c, Nexus4/5/10?, redmi note 9 pro
The list will probably be replenished as I own devices. Devices for which I have already released a port and sold them, the firmware will not be updated.

I want to myself and most likely I will buy a line of nexus smartphones and will mainly do this mod on them.

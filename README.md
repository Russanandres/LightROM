# Lightrom-hammerhead
# Only for Nexus 5 hammerhead!!
Completely stripped down ROM based on CyanogenMod 11. Almost all applications are cut out. Only the settings, music player, terminal and Titanium Backup remained. In the case of the ULTRA version - only the settings. You can install applications via ADB or terminal (not tested).
## Weight
- Lightrom - 168mb
- Lightrom ULTRA - 162mb

For now
## Other phones
This firmware at the time of 03/22/22+ **DOES NOT SUIT ANYONE EXCEPT NEXUS 5 HAMMERHEAD!!!!! THE AUTHOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR A DAMAGED DEVICE!!!!** (although during installation you can hardly brick it, but believe me, itâ€™s better not to try)
### Porting?
Maybe.
If it does, then first on nexus devices (4 and 10 (maybe)) and on Samsung devices (S2, S3, S7390). I'm not sure about others, I do it myself on my own devices.
## Bugs
Oh yeah. Bugs here are just a huge amount. Imagine all the people on earth (about 8 billion, right?) and multiply by 2. That will be the total number of bugs. Jokes aside, here are the known issues:
1. NFC - Partial work
2. Lockscreen - Can't set screen lock
3. Notification curtain - some shortcuts lead to system inoperability and reinstallation is required
4. Settings - Some items are throwing an error. (I know the fix, but let the rom be 1MB smaller)
5. Wallpapers - they are, but they write an error during installation. To fix it yourself, install the APK from cm11

## Q&A

- 8 - I don't have a cm8 capable device
- 9/10 - I don't know, probably yes, but not on nexus 5

- A - Yes. There will be an extended release (LightromEXtented?) where there will be a calculator, a camera and similar necessary things.
